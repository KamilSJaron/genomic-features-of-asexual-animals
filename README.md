# Review of asexual genomes

This repository serves for supplementary analyses performed for review of asexual genomes.

The idea of review is to put together all full genomes are of asexual eukaryotes (?animals not sure yet) and compare patterns observed.
One of difficulity would be to compare different genomics projects that are based on different inference methods and focus on different asepects.
This review aims to put them in a line taking this bias into account and unify analysis whenever it's easy ehough.

Potential analysis :

- esitmates of heterozygosity between haplotypes
- classification of repeats
- analysis of palindromes
- presnece genes involved in meiosis within the genome
