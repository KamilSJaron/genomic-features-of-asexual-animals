Relevant from Warren 2018:

"Our results provide support for earlier predictions that being a ‘frozen hybrid’ with elevated heterozygosity provides a fitness advantage (assuming polymorphisms improve fitness) and a possible resource for responses to natural selection."

What if hybrids are actually selected to maintain the heterozygosity? Gene conversion have a potential to reduce mutation meltdown, but it's not considering hybrid vigor.

-> removed from manuscript for being too far fetched.
