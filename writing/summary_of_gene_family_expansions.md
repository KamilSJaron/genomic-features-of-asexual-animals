Mention other studies???
- Some young asexuals (pea aphid and daphnia) have expansions (Simon et al. 2011).

Amazon molly: no unusual features to sexual teleosts; some meiosis genes CNV
Adineta vaga: expansion of RNA silencing machinery against TEs; several other gene families expanded (e.g. related to oxido-reduction processes, carbohydrate-active enzymes CAZymes). But again, could be specific lifestyle. (only speculations about adaptive functions)
Diploscapter coronatus: The performed analysis counted number of orthologous genes in D. cor and C. elegans (Table 2); 16092 genes had no change (2 in hapl. Separated assembly of D. cor; 1 in haplotype collapsed assembly of C. elegans); 748 were expanded in C. elegans; 3214 were expanded in D. coronatus; for 210 genes one copy was lost in D. coronatus. 14.157 genes had no orthology. I.e. if somebody would do GE analysis on the 3214 multiplied genes in D. coronatus, we could gene gene family expansion, but...
M. incognita: substantial expansion of cysteine & serine  proteases (compared to C elegans) (only speculations about adaptive functions)
F candida: expansion of stress gene families (only speculations adaptive function); but same for sexual collembolan, so probably no asex pattern.
T. pretiosum: Expansions of few gene families, more contractions. Other sexuals also show this pattern
Acrobeloides nanus: compared to C. elegans, some expanded, some contracted
Panagrolaimus spp.: some gene family expansions of species with cryptobiosis vs non-crypto; some expansions for P versus outgroup; speculative adaptation

Ramazzottius: Expansion of stress related genes (lifestyle, not neccessarily asex)
