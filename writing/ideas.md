# Common and unique features of sequenced obligately parthenogenetic genomes

The studies of role of sex are a renaissance in the era of genomics.
Till now XY genomes of XY asexual species were sequenced to reveal genomic consequences of asexual reproduction and thus reveal true role of sex in reproduction.
The studies have reported evaluation of an asexual genome or couple of asexual genomes within one taxa.
Here we present a collection of all currently sequenced asexual genomes combined with a meta study accessing which genomic features thought to be asexual are in fact taxon specific traits and which are shared among multiple phylogenetically distant asexual species.

## Introduction

## Methods

We have collected all single individual or a single clone obligately asexual genomes of metazoans.
The requirement of single individual or a single clone genome was based on comparability between genome, population sequencing can lead in biased estimations of heterozygosity and repetitive content, which are of interest in this study. This requirement have discriminated only mite genome (ref).
We have decided to omit non-metazoan Eukaryotes because sex in these species is not well defined very often (for example the weird parasexual fungi).
Also we were not sure if we were capable of establishing comprehensive list of all sequenced species (too honest?).


The majority of information were directly taken from publications.
We have decided to recompute


## Discussion

There are couple more transcriptomes. Like leneus worms.
