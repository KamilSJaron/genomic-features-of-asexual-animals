# Common and unique features of obligately parthenogenetic genomes

The studies of role of sex are going thought renaissance in the era of genomics.
Till now TODO genomes of TODO asexual species were sequenced to reveal genomic consequences of asexual reproduction and thus reveal true role of sex in reproduction.
The studies have reported evaluation of an asexual genome or couple of asexual genomes within one taxa.
Here we present a collection of all currently sequenced asexual genomes combined with a meta study accessing which genomic features thought to be asexual are in fact taxon specific traits and which are shared among multiple phylogenetically distant asexual species.

## Introduction

The sexual reproduction is thought to be essential trait for long term evolutionary success of species with limited population size {REF}.
It is vastly supported by phylogenetic distribution and relatively low frequency of asexual species {REF},
but also by theoretical predictions {REF} and experiments validating theory {REF}.

In last nine years TODO genomes were sequenced of TODO species. These studies brought a great insights to taxon specific effects of asexually to genomes.
Here we aimed to gather all currently available genomic resources of asexual metazoans to summarize common features of asexual evolution.
The sequenced asexual species are of various age of asexuality raging from couple of decades in Daphnia {REF} to ancient asexuals such as bdeliod rotifers that have survived more than TODO million years without sex {REF}.

However, it is still important to note, that sequenced asexual species represent only asexual lineages that were till now evolutionary successful - they survived.
Description of such set of species then represent a picture of (yet) not destructive genomic consequences of asexuality.

## Methods

We have collected all single individual or a single clone obligately asexual genomes of metazoans.
The requirement of single individual or a single clone genome was based on comparability between genome, population sequencing can lead in biased estimations of heterozygosity and repetitive content, which are of interest in this study. This requirement have discriminated only mite genome (ref).
We have decided to omit non-metazoan Eukaryotes because sex in these species is not well defined very often (for example the weird parasexual fungi).
Also we were not sure if we were capable of establishing comprehensive list of all sequenced species (too honest?).


The majority of information were directly taken from publications.
We have decided to recompute


## Discussion

There are couple more transcriptomes. Like lineus worms; great divergence of alleles but hybrids just like M. incognita.

Promising systems :

- _C. hookeri_ has sexual and asexual populations and a reference genome of the sexual is available already, disadvantage is it's enormous size (~4.5Gbp). C. hookeri could complement studies of very recent asexual _D. pulex_ show particularities in gene conversion. The system also suffering by contagious asexuality.
- Sequencing of tardigrades could complement studies of bdeliod rotifer since they are sharing tolerance to extreme environmental changes that could be related to asexuality. The downside is that we do not know much about tardigrade modes of reproduction, we just know that some of the populations are female only. However a comprehensive evaluation was not done till now. The second problem of this otherwise exciting system is difficulties for genome sequencing as was demonstrated.
